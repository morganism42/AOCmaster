###### Todays problem was about checking if a list of numbers were in the correct order, which is a very simple problem to solve in python, but I panicked wrote some code that worked but not how I thought it did. most people probably look at this problem and think to write a function to feed into list.sort(), I however wrote nested for loops while very tired and accidentally wrote exchange sort.

###### in a seperate note I'm sad to say that I have confirmed several people on the leaderboard this year are cheating, which is hard to do on AOC, theres only 3 ways and only 2 that are likely to get you on the leaderboard. the worst one being copying someone elses code, the other 2 are AI, and hacking AOC. they don't mind you using AI tools, like copilot or whatever as those don't know the question so can only answer based on what you've done, but there are people who have linked githubs that just have AI prompts for every day this year.
###### this isn't likely to work for long as after the first week they get more difficult and the AI can't keep up, but that just means a lot of people who would have been in the top 100 this year are less likely to be able to.
