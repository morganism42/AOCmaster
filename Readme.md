This is a collection of my Advent of Code solutions, in order for them to work you will need to install and setup the module advent of code data.

One of my goals for this will be to complete all AOC puzzles up to the current year, and to occasionally share my thoughts on certain puzzles I think deserve a bit more attention, though the writing will be limited to any year after 2023 as I am starting this project in 2024.

### years I have completed:
- [2023](/2023)
### Markdown files for years after 2023:
- [2024](2024/2024.md)
- [2025](2025/2025.md)
### Years I am currently working on:
